        <h1>New Year celebrations</h1>
        <p>
          On the night of 31 December and the morning of 1 January, people in many countries all over
          the world will celebrate the beginning of a new year. How will they celebrate and how did this
          tradition begin?
        </p>

        <p>Do the preparation task first. Then read the article and do the exercises.</p>

        <p>
          'For last year's words belong to last year's language And next year's words await another
          voice. And to make an end is to make a beginning.' – TS Eliot
        </p>

        <h2>New year, old celebrations</h2>
        <p>
          There have been celebrations to mark the beginning of a new year for thousands of years.
          Sometimes these were simply an opportunity for people to eat, drink and have fun, but in some
          places the festivities were connected to the land or astronomical events. For example, in
          Egypt the beginning of the year coincided with when the River Nile flooded, and this normally
          happened when the star Sirius rose. The Persians and Phoenicians started their new year at the
          spring equinox (this is around 20 March when the Sun shines more or less directly on the
          equator and the length of the night and the day are almost the same).
        </p>

        <h2>The oldest celebration</h2>
        <p>
          The city of Babylon in ancient Mesopotamia was where the first New Year's celebrations were
          recorded about 4,000 years ago. The Babylonians held their celebrations on the first new moon
          after the spring equinox and called this festival Akitu (which comes from the word the
          Sumerians used for barley). Barley was cut in Mesopotamia in the spring, and during Akitu
          there was a different ritual on each of the 11 days that the celebration lasted. Statues of
          the gods were carried through the streets of the city, and in this way the Babylonians
          believed that their world had been cleaned to prepare for the new year and a new spring.
        </p>

        <h2>Modern celebrations</h2>
        <p>
          In many cities all over the world, spectacular fireworks displays take place as soon as the
          clock passes midnight on 31 December. In recent years, Sydney in Australia has been the host
          to one of the first of these celebrations as New Year arrives there before most other major
          international cities. The display takes place in Sydney Harbour, with the Opera House and
          Harbour Bridge making it a stunning setting. Fireworks light up the skies in hundreds of
          cities as 12 midnight strikes around the globe.
        </p>
        <h2>Traditions that live on</h2>
        <p>
          There are a number of strange and interesting New Year's traditions around the world. In
          Scotland, New Year's Eve is called Hogmanay and 'first footing' remains a popular custom with
          people visiting friends' and neighbours' houses just after midnight. The first person who
          visits your house should bring a gift as this will mean good luck. In Spain, it is the custom
          to eat 12 grapes as the bells sound for midnight on 31 December. One grape is eaten at each
          sound of the bell and each grape is supposed to bring good luck for each month of the year
          ahead. In Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Venezuela and some other Central and South American
          countries, people wear special underwear of different colours on New Year's Eve. Red is
          supposed to be good for bringing love in the new year, while yellow is supposed to bring
          money.
        </p>

        <h2>Out with the old, in with the new</h2>
        <p>
          The new year is a perfect time to make a change for the better. The tradition of making New
          Year's resolutions is more common in the western hemisphere but also exists in the eastern
          hemisphere. This tradition involves a person making a commitment to change an unwanted habit
          or behaviour or setting a personal objective. Typical New Year's resolutions might be to give
          up smoking, eat healthier food, do more exercise, become more organised or laugh more – but
          really, a New Year's resolution can be almost anything. However, research suggests that many
          New Year's resolutions fail. Being realistic about the objectives you set and not making too
          many New Year's resolutions might help you to achieve success.
