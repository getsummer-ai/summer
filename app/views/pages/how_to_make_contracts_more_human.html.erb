    <h1>How to make contracts more human</h1>
    <p>
      Unlock the power of innovative tools like Enty to learn how to simplify contracts, foster collaboration, and enhance relationships.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contracts - a word that often sounds scary, although we also know them as the cornerstone of closing business deals,
      the glue that binds partnerships, and the roadmap to success.
      Yet, in the labyrinth of legal jargon and convoluted clauses many individuals,
      including lawyers, find themselves frustrated by the complex language, cumbersome processes,
      and lengthy negotiations that contracts entail.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, a study by IACCM revealed that a staggering 83% of people are dissatisfied with the contract process.
      It's time for a change, and today we will be learning how to make contracts more humane.
      By following these steps, you can improve the contract experience for all parties involved,
      streamline the negotiation process, and foster stronger business relationships. Let's dive in!
    </p>

    <h2>Embrace clarity</h2>

    <p>
      Legal documents have long been known for their convoluted language and excessive length.
      But simplicity and clarity should not be optional in the contract creation process.
      Lengthy contracts are often a turn-off for individuals who are asked to read and understand them.
      To avoid overwhelming your counterparts and make the process of signing easier, always try to make
      your contracts shorter and more straightforward.
    </p>
    <p>
      While it may be challenging to avoid dense legal information entirely,
      complicated wording and standardized clauses can often be eliminated without sacrificing
      the effectiveness of the contract. By reducing the length and stating conditions in a more
      concise way, you can create contracts that are more reader-friendly and easier to comprehend.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      One easy win is simply to make legal documents shorter.
      Of course, sometimes it’s impossible to avoid dense legal information,
      but more often than not, boilerplate wording and standardized clauses add
      no real value and denigrate the contract experience
      — Richard Mabey
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Additionally, consider providing summaries or executive overviews of contracts to help people
      grasp the key obligations and rights outlined in the document.
      By condensing complex legal terms into clear and concise language, you can enhance the overall
      readability and hence speed of reviewing contracts.
    </p>

    <h2>Tailor templates for effective communication</h2>
    <p>
      Historically, contracts have been written by lawyers, for lawyers, often neglecting the needs and understanding
      of the individuals they’re meant to serve. To create truly effective contracts,
      it’s essential to consider the intended audience and tailor the content accordingly.
      Contracts should be useful and engaging instruments that express business relationships,
      rather than a way to confuse your potential partners.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, when drafting an employment contract for a candidate with no legal background, it's crucial to provide clear and straightforward information about their obligations and rights. Random references to legislation or complex legal terminology can hinder their understanding and create unnecessary confusion.
      By adopting a more user-centric approach, you can create contracts that are accessible to individuals from various backgrounds and levels of legal knowledge. Consider using plain language, defining key terms, and organizing the content in a logical and user-friendly manner. This will empower all parties to understand and engage with the contract more effectively. Luckily, today business owners can make use of tools like Enty’s contract service, where they can get a quick contract summary, and even get a score of the effectiveness of a contract.
    </p>

    <h2>Continuously improve templates based on data insights</h2>
    <p>In many organizations, contract templates are created by external counsel, often using standard clauses that may not adequately address the specific needs of internal clients. To enhance the effectiveness of your templates and streamline negotiations, it's crucial to iterate on them over time. Data-driven insights can play a significant role in this process.</p>
    <p>By analyzing contract data, such as frequently negotiated clauses and areas of contention, you can identify opportunities for improvement. You can then refine your templates and make them better aligned with your business needs. This will also reduce the time needed for review, and help in more effective negotiations. This approach ensures that your templates evolve to meet the changing demands of your organization and clients.</p>

    <h2>Foster collaboration in contract workflows</h2>
    <p>
      The back-and-forth between legal and business teams has long been a source of friction in the contract process. To ease the tension and build better working relationships, it's essential to foster collaboration throughout the contract workflow.
      Transparency is key. By making contract data easily accessible to all stakeholders, you can provide visibility into the progress of contract negotiations and prevent unnecessary delays. Tools like Enty allow you to manage contract-related processes more efficiently, creating an inclusive and collaborative environment.
      To further streamline collaboration, integrate contract templates with existing systems used by business teams. For example, if your organization utilizes Salesforce or Slack for internal communications, consider integrating contract workflows into these platforms. By aligning contract management with existing workflows, you can improve efficiency and ensure seamless collaboration between legal and business teams.
    </p>

    <h2>Harness the power of structured contract data</h2>
    <p>One of the biggest challenges in contract management is dealing with unstructured data. Contracts typically contain critical information such as party names, clauses, renewal dates, and more, but extracting and utilizing this data efficiently can be a daunting task.</p>
    <p>To overcome this challenge, organizations can leverage automation tools to extract data from existing contracts. These will usually use machine learning algorithms to identify and categorize important data points. Alternatively, contract management software like Enty allows you to structure and extract data as contracts are created. This shift from manual processing to automated, data-driven processes enables organizations to optimize contract management and ensure a more efficient and transparent experience for all parties involved.</p>
    <h2>Leverage AI for contract creation and review</h2>
    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) can play a significant role in making contract creation and review more efficient and accurate.</p>
    <p>Enty utilizes AI to review and even generate contracts, although you can also benefit from 10s of templates that we created together with professional lawyers. By leveraging the new technology, organizations can expedite the contract creation process, reduce errors, and ensure consistency across various contracts. Additionally, AI-powered contract review tools can analyze contracts for potential risks, inconsistencies, and compliance issues, saving time and resources for legal teams.</p>
    <p>By incorporating AI into the contract management workflow, you can streamline processes, improve accuracy, and enhance the overall contract experience for all stakeholders.</p>
    <h2>Develop standardized contract workflows</h2>
    <p>
      Standardizing contract workflows is essential to ensure consistent processes and minimize errors or bottlenecks. By defining clear steps, roles, and responsibilities within the contract management process, organizations can streamline operations and improve efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>Consider creating standardized workflows that outline the necessary steps from contract creation to signature and beyond. This can include stages such as contract drafting, internal reviews, external negotiations, and final approval. By establishing clear guidelines and automating workflow steps, organizations can reduce delays, improve collaboration, and increase overall productivity.
    </p>

This includes features such as data encryption, secure storage, and user access controls.</p>
